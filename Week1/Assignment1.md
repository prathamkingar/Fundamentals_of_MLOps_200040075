## 1. What is meant by the term AIOps, & then contrast it with MLOps.
### AIOps
AIOps is a series of multi-layered platforms that automate IT to make it more efficient.
AIOps allows teams to improve their IT infrastructure by using big data, advanced analytics, and machine learning techniques.
AIOps' ultimate goal is enhancing IT operations. The central process in AIOps is the intelligent filtering of signals or of the noise in IT system.
### Difference between AIOps and MLOps
MLOps' goal is bridging the gap between data scientists and operation teams, therefore between ML model building and their execution.
AIOps focuses on automating incidents management and intelligent root cause analysis.
In a more concise way: AIOps automates machines while MLOps standardizes processes.

## 2. What it means for a linear regression model to be interpretable 
Interpretability is the degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision. 
In other words, interpretability is the degree to which a human can consistently predict the model's result 
A linear regression model predicts the target as a weighted sum of the feature inputs.
The biggest advantage of linear regression models is linearity:
It makes the estimation procedure simple and, most importantly, these linear equations have an easy to understand interpretation on a modular level (i.e. the weights)

The linearity of the learned relationship makes the interpretation easy. 
Linearity leads to interpretable models. 
Linear effects are easy to quantify and describe. They are additive, so it is easy to separate the effects. 
If you suspect feature interactions or a nonlinear association of a feature with the target value, you can add interaction terms or use regression splines.
